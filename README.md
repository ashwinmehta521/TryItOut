Finding the shortest path using A* algorithm 
A* algorithm assures the most optimal solution
This program finds the shortest path in a NxN maze and calculates the cost of the reaching the goal from the start point
The assumption for the movement cost is 1 for diagonal movement and 2 for R/L/U/D. However, it can be changed as per the requirement
The heuristics used is euclidean distance
